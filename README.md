**`IT Student in the EU. Intermediate at best on a good day...`**

#### I'm an IT Technology student hailing from somewhere in the EU. My main passion is the Cybersec field, but I am generally interested in all different kinds of technologies. I often find myself daydreaming about a solarpunk-ish future ğŸŒ‡

---
#### Currently, I'm most focused on these programming/scripting langauges.
